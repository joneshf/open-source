## 0.1.0.0

* Extract core rollbar to its own package

    This is almost entirely copy-pasted from [`wai-middleware-rollbar` version 0.8.4](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai-middleware-rollbar-0.8.4).

    The intent is to make the core data types available for other packages.
    If this gets unweildy, move it right back.
